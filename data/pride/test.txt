Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his <unk> his <unk> engagement with Miss de Bourgh ?
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? ” “ Yes ; and I had heard it before .
But what is that to me ?
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh .
You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage .
Its <unk> depended on others .
If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?
And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? ” “ Because honour , decorum , <unk> , <unk> it .
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him .
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . ” “ These are heavy misfortunes , ” replied Elizabeth .
“ But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . ” “ <unk> , headstrong girl !
I am ashamed of you !
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?
Is nothing due to me on that score ?
Let us sit down .
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be <unk> from it .
I have not been used to submit to any person ’ s whims .
I have not been in the habit of <unk> disappointment . ” “ _ That _ will make your Ladyship ’ s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _ me _ . ” “ I will not be interrupted !
<unk> me in silence .
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .
They are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ’ s , from respectable , honourable , and <unk> , though <unk> , families .
Their fortune on both sides is splendid .
They are destined for each other by the voice of every <unk> of their <unk> houses ; and what is to divide them ? <unk> <unk> pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune !
Is this to be endured ?
But it must not , shall not be !
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . ” “ In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ’ s daughter ; so far we are equal . ” “ True .
You _ are _ a gentleman ’ s daughter .
But what was your mother ?
Who are your uncles and <unk> ?
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . ” “ Whatever my connections may be , ” said Elizabeth , “ if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . ” “ Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? ” Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment ’ s deliberation , -- “ I am not . ” Lady Catherine seemed pleased .
“ And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement ? ” “ I will make no promise of the kind . ” “ Miss Bennet , I am shocked and astonished .
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <unk> .
I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . ” “ And I certainly _ never _ shall give it .
I am not to be <unk> into anything so wholly unreasonable .
Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ?
<unk> him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such <unk> as these .
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .
I must beg , therefore , to be <unk> no further on the subject . ” “ Not so hasty , if you please .
I have by no means done .
To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add .
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ’ s infamous elopement .
I know it all ; that the young man ’ s marrying her was a <unk> business , at the expense of your father and uncle .
And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew ’ s sister ?
Is _ her _ husband , who is the son of his late father ’ s steward , to be his brother ?
Heaven and <unk> ! <unk> what are you thinking ?
Are the <unk> of Pemberley to be thus <unk> ? ” “ You can _ now _ have nothing further to say , ” she resentfully answered .
“ You have <unk> me , in every possible method .
I must beg to return to the house . ” And she rose as she spoke .
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .
Her Ladyship was highly incensed .
“ You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !
<unk> , selfish girl !
Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? ” “ Lady Catherine , I have nothing further to say .
You know my sentiments . ” “ You are then resolved to have him ? ” “ I have said no such thing .
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , <unk> my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . ” “ It is well .
You refuse , then , to oblige me .
You refuse to <unk> the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ” “ Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , ” replied Elizabeth , “ has any possible claim on me , in the present instance .
No principle of either would be <unk> by my marriage with Mr. Darcy .
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ’ s <unk> the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <unk> . ” “ And this is your real opinion !
This is your final resolve !
Very well .
I shall now know how to act .
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <unk> will ever be gratified .
I came to try you .
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . ” In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , -- “ I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .
I send no compliments to your mother .
You deserve no such attention .
I am most seriously displeased . ” Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her Ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs .
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
“ She did not choose it , ” said her daughter ; “ she would go . ” “ She is a very <unk> woman !
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say ; and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? ” Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
&#91; Illustration : “ But now it comes out ” &#93; CHAPTER <unk> .
&#91; Illustration &#93; The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly .
Lady Catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy .
It was a rational scheme , to be sure !
but from what the report of their engagement could <unk> , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of Bingley , and _ her _ being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea .
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached Lady Catherine , ) had only set _ that _ down as almost certain and immediate which _ she _ had looked forward to as possible at some future time .
In <unk> Lady Catherine ’ s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <unk> in this interference .
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce .
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <unk> of a marriage with _ one _ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <unk> side .
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <unk> <unk> .
If he had been <unk> before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity <unk> could make him .
In that case he would return no more .
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .
“ If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , ” she added , “ I shall know how to understand it .
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his <unk> .
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . ” The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great : but they <unk> satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had <unk> Mrs. Bennet ’ s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject .
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
“ Lizzy , ” said he , “ I was going to look for you : come into my room . ” She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine , and she anticipated with <unk> all the <unk> explanations .
She followed her father to the fireplace , and they both sat down .
He then said , -- “ I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
I did not know before that I had _ two _ daughters on the brink of matrimony .
Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . ” The colour now <unk> into Elizabeth ’ s cheeks in the <unk> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <unk> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself , when her father continued , -- “ You look conscious .
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even _ your _ <unk> to discover the name of your admirer .
This letter is from Mr. Collins . ” “ From Mr. Collins !
and what can _ he _ have to say ? ” “ Something very much to the purpose , of course .
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good-natured , <unk> Lucases .
I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point .
What relates to yourself is as follows : -- ‘ Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another , of which we have been <unk> by the same authority .
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is <unk> , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most <unk> personages in this <unk> . ’ Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ?
‘ This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with everything the heart of mortal can most desire , <unk> property , noble <unk> , and extensive patronage .
Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may <unk> by a precipitate <unk> with this gentleman ’ s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ’ Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
But now it comes out .
‘ My motive for cautioning you is as follows : <unk> have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ’ _ Mr.
Darcy _ , you see , is the man !
Now , Lizzy , I think I _ have _ surprised you .
Could he , or the Lucases , have <unk> on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a <unk> , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in his life !
It is admirable ! ” Elizabeth tried to join in her father ’ s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
“ Are you not diverted ? ” “ Oh , yes .
Pray read on . ” “ ‘ After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she <unk> so disgraceful a match .
I thought it my duty to give the <unk> intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ’ Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , ‘ I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ’ s sad business has been so well <unk> up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from <unk> my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .
You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ’ _ That _ is his notion of Christian forgiveness !
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ’ s situation , and his expectation of a young <unk> .
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
You are not going to be _ <unk> _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ” “ Oh , ” cried Elizabeth , “ I am exceedingly diverted .
But it is so strange ! ” “ Yes , _ that _ is what makes it amusing .
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference and _ your _ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd !
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins ’ s correspondence for any consideration .
Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <unk> of my son-in-law .
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?
Did she call to refuse her consent ? ” To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
It was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried .
Her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of Mr. Darcy ’ s indifference ; and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that , perhaps , instead of his seeing too _ little _ , she might have fancied too _ much _ .
&#91; Illustration : “ The efforts of his aunt ” &#91; _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ &#93; &#93; CHAPTER <unk> .
&#91; Illustration &#93; Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ’ s visit .
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .
It was agreed to .
Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to <unk> them .
They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy were to entertain each other .
Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and , perhaps , he might be doing the same .
They walked towards the Lucases ’ , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them she went <unk> on with him alone .
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed ; and while her courage was high , she immediately said , -- “ Mr.
Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours .
I can no longer help thanking you for your <unk> kindness to my poor sister .
<unk> since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .
Were it known to the rest of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ” “ I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , ” replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , “ that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . ” “ You must not blame my aunt .
Lydia ’ s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <unk> , for the sake of <unk> them . ” “ If you _ will _ thank me , ” he replied , “ let it be for yourself alone .
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other <unk> which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .
But your _ family _ owe me nothing .
Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of _ you _ . ” Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
After a short pause , her companion added , “ You are too generous to trifle with me .
If your feelings are still what they were last <unk> , tell me so at once .
_ My _ affections and wishes are <unk> ; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ” Elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very <unk> , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances .
The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes , she might have seen how well the expression of <unk> delight <unk> over his face became him : but though she could not look she could listen ; and he told her of feelings which , in <unk> of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
They walked on without knowing in what direction .
There was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who _ did _ call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling <unk> on every expression of the latter , which , in her Ladyship ’ s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _ she _ had refused to give .
But , unluckily for her Ladyship , its effect had been exactly <unk> .
“ It taught me to hope , ” said he , “ as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , <unk> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine <unk> and openly . ” Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , “ Yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that _ .
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ” “ What did you say of me that I did not deserve ?
For though your accusations were <unk> , formed on mistaken <unk> , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the <unk> reproof .
It was unpardonable .
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . ” “ We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <unk> to that evening , ” said Elizabeth .
“ The conduct of neither , if <unk> examined , will be <unk> ; but since then we have both , I hope , improved in civility . ” “ I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , <unk> painful to me .
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ‘ Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ’ Those were your words .
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <unk> me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . ” “ I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ” “ I can easily believe it .
You thought me then <unk> of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . ” “ Oh , do not repeat what I then said .
These recollections will not do at all .
I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . ” Darcy mentioned his letter .
“ Did it , ” said he , -- “ did it _ soon _ make you think better of me ?
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? ” She explained what its effects on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .
“ I knew , ” said he , “ that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .
I hope you have destroyed the letter .
There was one part , especially the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ” “ The letter shall certainly be <unk> , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <unk> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <unk> . ” “ When I wrote that letter , ” replied Darcy , “ I believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . ” “ The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .
The adieu is <unk> itself .
But think no more of the letter .
The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten .
You must learn some of my philosophy .
<unk> only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . ” “ I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .
_ Your _ <unk> must be so totally <unk> of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance .
But with _ me _ , it is not so .
<unk> recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be <unk> .
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .
As a child I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper .
I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .
<unk> an only son ( for many years an only _ child _ ) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was <unk> and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .
Such I was , from eight to <unk> ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <unk> Elizabeth !
What do I not owe you !
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .
By you , I was properly humbled .
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . ” “ Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? ” “ Indeed I had .
What will you think of my vanity ?
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . ” “ My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you .
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .
How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ! ” “ <unk> you !
I was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . ” “ I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley .
You <unk> me for coming ? ” “ No , indeed , I felt nothing but surprise . ” “ Your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you .
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . ” “ My object _ then _ , ” replied Darcy , “ was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves , I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . ” He then told her of Georgiana ’ s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther .
After walking several miles in a <unk> manner , and too <unk> to know anything about it , they found at last , on examining their <unk> , that it was time to be at home .
“ What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ? ” was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _ their _ affairs .
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .
“ I must ask whether you were surprised ? ” said Elizabeth .
“ Not at all .
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . ” “ That is to say , you had given your permission .
I guessed as much . ” And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .
“ On the evening before my going to London , ” said he , “ I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent .
His surprise was great .
He had never had the slightest suspicion .
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <unk> , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . ” Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .
“ Did you speak from your own observation , ” said she , “ when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? ” “ From the former .
I had narrowly observed her , during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . ” “ And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . ” “ It did .
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made everything easy .
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .
He was angry .
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ’ s sentiments .
He has heartily <unk> me now . ” Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin .
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .
In the hall they parted .
&#91; Illustration : “ Unable to utter a syllable ” &#91; _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ &#93; &#93; CHAPTER <unk> .
&#91; Illustration &#93; “ My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? ” was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge .
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .
The evening passed quietly , <unk> by anything extraordinary .
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed ; the <unk> were silent .
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <unk> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known : she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _ dislike _ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
At night she opened her heart to Jane .
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ’ s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
“ You are <unk> , Lizzy .
This cannot be !
Engaged to Mr. Darcy !
No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . ” “ This is a wretched beginning , indeed !
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .
I speak nothing but the truth .
He still loves me , and we are engaged . ” Jane looked at her <unk> .
“ Oh , Lizzy !
it cannot be .
I know how much you dislike him . ” “ You know nothing of the matter .
_ That _ is all to be forgot .
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable .
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . ” Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .
Elizabeth again , and more seriously , assured her of its truth .
“ Good heaven !
can it be really so ?
Yet now I must believe you , ” cried Jane .
“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you <unk> the <unk> you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ” “ There can be no doubt of that .
It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .
But are you pleased , Jane ?
Shall you like to have such a brother ? ” “ Very , very much .
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .
And do you really love him quite well enough ?
Oh , Lizzy !
do anything rather than marry without affection .
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? ” “ Oh , yes !
You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley .
I am afraid you will be angry . ” “ My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious .
I want to talk very seriously .
Let me know everything that I am to know without delay .
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ” “ It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . ” Another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish .
“ Now I am quite happy , ” said she , “ for you will be as happy as myself .
I always had a value for him .
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ’ s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .
But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !
I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . ” Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia ’ s marriage .
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .
“ Good gracious ! ” cried Mrs. Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , “ if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
I had no notion but he would go <unk> , or something or other , and not <unk> us with his company .
What shall we do with him ?
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ’ s way . ” Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <unk> .
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , “ Mrs.
Bennet , have you no more <unk> hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day ? ” “ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ to walk to <unk> Mount this morning .
It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ” “ It may do very well for the others , ” replied Mr. Bingley ; “ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .
<unk> ’ t it , Kitty ? ” Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .
As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying , -- “ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it .
It is all for Jane ’ s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ” During their walk , it was resolved that Mr. Bennet ’ s consent should be asked in the course of the evening : Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ’ s .
She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man ; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <unk> of her disapprobation .
In the evening , soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
She did not fear her father ’ s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means ; that _ she _ , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <unk> him with fears and regrets in <unk> of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , “ Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . ” She was gone directly .
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .
“ Lizzy , ” said he , “ what are you doing ?
Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ?
Have not you always hated him ? ” How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr. Darcy .
“ <unk> , in other words , you are determined to have him .
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .
But will they make you happy ? ” “ Have you any other objection , ” said Elizabeth , “ than your belief of my indifference ? ” “ <unk> at all .
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ” “ I do , I do like him , ” she replied , with tears in her eyes ; “ I love him .
Indeed he has no improper pride .
He is perfectly amiable .
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ” “ Lizzy , ” said her father , “ I have given him my consent .
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask .
I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him .
But let me advise you to think better of it .
I know your disposition , Lizzy .
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior .
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life .
You know not what you are about . ” Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <unk> of many months ’ suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ’ s incredulity , and <unk> him to the match .
“ Well , my dear , ” said he , when she ceased speaking , “ I have no more to say .
If this be the case , he deserves you .
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . ” To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .
He heard her with astonishment .
“ This is an evening of wonders , indeed !
And so , Darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ’ s debts , and got him his commission !
So much the better .
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .
Had it been your uncle ’ s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way .
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow , he will <unk> and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ” He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr. Collins ’ s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go , saying , as she quitted the room , “ If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . ” Elizabeth ’ s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ’ s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
Everything was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <unk> away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for , on first hearing it , Mrs. Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard , though not in general <unk> to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .
She began at length to recover , to <unk> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
“ Good gracious !
Lord bless me !
only think !
dear me !
Mr. Darcy !
Who would have thought it ?
And is it really true ?
Oh , my sweetest Lizzy !
how rich and how great you will be !
What <unk> , what <unk> , what carriages you will have !
Jane ’ s is nothing to <unk> at all .
I am so <unk> happy .
Such a charming man !
so handsome !
so tall !
Oh , my dear Lizzy !
pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before .
I hope he will overlook it .
Dear , dear Lizzy .
A house in town !
Everything that is charming !
<unk> daughters married !
Ten thousand a year !
Oh , Lord !
what will become of me ?
I shall go distracted . ” This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted ; and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
“ My dearest child , ” she cried , “ I can think of nothing else .
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more !
’ Tis as good as a <unk> !
And a special <unk> must and shall be married by a special <unk> .
But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to-morrow . ” This was a sad <unk> of what her mother ’ s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ’ consent , there was still something to be wished for .
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
“ I admire all my three <unk> highly , ” said he .
“ Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane ’ s . ” &#91; Illustration : “ The obsequious civility . ” &#91; _ Copyright 1894 by George Allen . _ &#93; &#93; CHAPTER <unk> .
&#91; Illustration &#93; Elizabeth ’ s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .
“ How could you begin ? ” said she .
“ I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? ” “ I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .
It is too long ago .
I was in the middle before I knew that I _ had _ begun . ” “ My beauty you had early <unk> , and as for my <unk> behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .
Now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? ” “ For the liveliness of your mind I did . ” “ You may as well call it impertinence at once .
It was very little less .
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone .
I roused and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ .
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so <unk> courted you .
<unk> have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .
To be sure you know no actual good of <unk> nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . ” “ Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? ” “ Dearest Jane !
who could have done less for her ?
But make a virtue of it by all means .
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <unk> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ?
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? ” “ Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . ” “ But I was embarrassed . ” “ And so was I. ” “ You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . ” “ A man who had felt less might . ” “ How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !
But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .
I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken if I had not asked you !
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .
_ <unk> much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <unk> from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?
This will never do . ” “ You need not distress yourself .
The moral will be perfectly fair .
Lady Catherine ’ s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts .
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .
I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours .
My aunt ’ s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know everything . ” “ Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?
or had you intended any more serious consequences ? ” “ My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . ” “ Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? ” “ I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .
But it ought to be done ; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . ” “ And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ” From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been <unk> , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’ s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : -- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory <unk> of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write .
You supposed more than really existed .
But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a <unk> to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .
I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes .
How could I be so silly as to wish it !
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .
We will go round the park every day .
I am the happiest creature in the world .
Perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice .
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh .
Mr. Darcy <unk> you all the love in the world that can be spared from me .
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .
Yours , ” etc .
Mr. Darcy ’ s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins , in return for his last .
/ * “ Dear Sir , * / “ I must trouble you once more for congratulations .
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy .
<unk> Lady Catherine as well as you can .
But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .
He has more to give .
“ Yours sincerely , ” etc .
Miss Bingley ’ s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere .
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother ’ s in <unk> it .
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge .
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ’ s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <unk> over .
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the <unk> and obsequious civility of her husband .
He bore it , however , with admirable calmness .
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <unk> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James ’ s , with very decent composure .
If he did <unk> his <unk> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .
Mrs. Philips ’ s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ’ s good-humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar .
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
Elizabeth did all she could to <unk> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .
&#91; Illustration &#93; CHAPTER LXI .
&#91; Illustration &#93; Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley , and talked of Mrs. Darcy , may be guessed .
I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , <unk> woman for the rest of her life ; though , perhaps , it was lucky for her husband , who might not have <unk> domestic felicity in so <unk> a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do .
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .
So near a <unk> to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart .
The <unk> wish of his sisters was then gratified : he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire ; and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .
She was not of so <unk> a temper as Lydia ; and , removed from the influence of Lydia ’ s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .
From the further disadvantage of Lydia ’ s society she was of course carefully kept ; and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet ’ s being quite unable to sit alone .
Mary was obliged to <unk> more with the world , but she could still <unk> over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by <unk> between her sisters ’ beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she <unk> to the change without much <unk> .
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <unk> from the marriage of her sisters .
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <unk> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and , in spite of everything , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .
The <unk> letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .
The letter was to this effect : -- / * “ My dear Lizzy , * / “ I wish you joy .
If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .
It is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
<unk> place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
“ Yours , ” etc .
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind .
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses , she frequently sent them .
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and <unk> of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their <unk> .
Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference : hers lasted a little longer ; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .
Though Darcy could never receive _ him _ at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ’ s sake , he assisted him further in his profession .
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or <unk> ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even Bingley ’ s good-humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone .
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy ’ s marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to <unk> the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropped all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as <unk> , and paid off every <unk> of civility to Elizabeth .
Pemberley was now Georgiana ’ s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , <unk> manner of talking to her brother .
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .
By Elizabeth ’ s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <unk> with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .
But at length , by Elizabeth ’ s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that <unk> which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the <unk> .
With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms .
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of <unk> them .
